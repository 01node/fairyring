# Validator Setup

This section details the steps required to become a validator on the FairyRing chain

Validitors on FairyRing have two main purposes:

- Participate in consensus to generate blocks. This functionality is the same as with any other chain on Cosmos.
- Submit Keyshares at every block

This second functionality is the crux of the FairyRing chain.

> NOTE: It is not mandatory for all validators to submit keyshares. They can opt in for this functionality.
