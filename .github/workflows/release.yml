# This workflow is useful if you want to automate the process of:
#
# a) Creating a new prelease when you push a new tag with a "v" prefix (version).
#
#    This type of prerelease is meant to be used for production: alpha, beta, rc, etc. types of releases.
#    After the prerelease is created, you need to make your changes on the release page at the relevant
#    Github page and publish your release.
#
# b) Creating/updating the "latest" prerelease when you push to your default branch.
#
#    This type of prelease is useful to make your bleeding-edge binaries available to advanced users.
#
# The workflow will not run if there is no tag pushed with a "v" prefix and no change pushed to your 
# default branch.
